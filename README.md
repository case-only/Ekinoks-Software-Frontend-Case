# React Pokédex Challenge

This challenge is to build a simple Pokédex application using React and the Poké API. You have **1 week** to complete this challenge. Note that **Expo usage is not permitted**.

## Requirements
Your application must include the following features:

### Core Features
1. **List Pokémons**: 
   - Fetch and display a list of Pokémons using the [Poké API](https://pokeapi.co/).

2. **Pokémon Details**:
   - Display details of a selected Pokémon, including any descriptions or data you deem important.

3. **Catch Pokémons**:
   - Allow users to "catch" Pokémons and maintain a record in **Redux**.

4. **Release Pokémons**:
   - Enable users to release caught Pokémons.

5. **List Caught Pokémons**:
   - Provide a separate view to list all caught Pokémons.

6. **Favorites Management**:
   - Allow users to add/remove caught Pokémons to/from a favorites list.

### Additional Features
1. **Dark Theme or Language Support**:
   - Implement a dark theme toggle or support for multiple languages in the application.

2. **Test Case**:
   - Write at least one test case using a testing library (e.g., Jest, React Testing Library).

## Grading Criteria
The grading of your application will be based on the following criteria:

### 1. UI and UX (30%)
- Ensure the app is visually appealing and user-friendly.
- Provide a responsive design that works across different devices.

### 2. Overall Design and Structure (40%)
- Maintain a clean and modular codebase.
- Follow best practices for React development.
- Use functional components and hooks effectively.
- Structure your Redux store appropriately.

### 3. Data Management and Store (30%)
- Efficiently manage state with Redux.
- Handle API calls and manage asynchronous operations cleanly.
- Ensure caught Pokémon data is persisted correctly in the Redux store.

## Submission Guidelines
- Include clear instructions on how to run your project in a `README.md` file.
- Use Git for version control and submit your project as a GitHub repository link.

## Suggested Tools and Libraries
- **React**: Core framework for building the UI.
- **Redux**: For state management.
- **React Router**: For navigation and routing.
- **Axios or Fetch**: For API calls.
- **Jest/React Testing Library**: For testing.
- **CSS Frameworks** (optional): Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, or Material-UI for styling.

## Getting Started
1. Set up a React application using your preferred method (e.g., Create React App or Vite).
2. Install dependencies for Redux and testing libraries.
3. Use the Poké API to fetch Pokémon data.
4. Implement the required features step by step, ensuring a clean codebase.
5. Add test cases to validate your functionality.
6. Review and test your application thoroughly before submission.
